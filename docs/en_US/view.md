Views simply create a custom view. This
is not as powerful as the designs but it allows a few
minutes to have a more personalized display.

Views can be accessed from the Home â†’ View menu:

> In your profile, you can choose the default view when clicking

The views
========

We can put both widgets, graphics (which can be
composed of more than one data) or table fields (which contain the
widgets of the commands).

On this page, there is a button at the top left to show or
hide the list of views as well as the button to add one
(Jeedom will ask you his name and send you to the edit page):

> **Tip**
>
> You can in your profile modify this option so that the list
> views are visible by default.

A button at the top right allows you to edit the current view.

Add / Edit a view
=======================

The principle is quite simple: a view is composed of zones (we can
put as much as you want). Each zone is of graphic type, widget
or table, depending on the type you can put widgets
equipment, control or graphics in it.

> **Tip**
>
> It is possible to move the order of the zones by drag and drop.

On the left of the page we find the list of views and a
add button.

In the center you have a button to rename a view, an add button
zone, a button to see the result, a button to save and
a button to delete the view.

After clicking the add zone button, Jeedom will ask you
his name and his type.

On each zone you have the following general options:

-   **Width**: Sets the width of the area (when in
    desktop only)

-   **Edit**: change the name of the area

-   **Delete**: deletes the area

Widget type zone

A widget type zone allows you to add widgets:

-   **Add widget**: allows you to add / edit widgets to

> You can delete a widget directly by clicking on the
> trash in front of it.

> It is possible to change the order of the widgets in the area by
> drag and drop.

Once the widget addition button is pressed, you get a window
who will ask you the widget to add
