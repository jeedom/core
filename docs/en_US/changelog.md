>
> Following the update, you MUST go to Settings → System → Configuration Update / Market tab and enter the cloud backup password confirmation so that it can be done.

### 4.2 : Security

- In order to significantly increase the security of the Jeedom solution, the file access system has changed. Before certain files were prohibited from certain locations. From v4.2, files are explicitly allowed by type and location.
- Change at the API level, previously "tolerant" if you arrived with the Core key indicating plugin XXXXX. This is no longer the case, you must arrive with the key corresponding to the plugin.
- In http API you could indicate a plugin name in type, this is no longer possible. The type corresponding to the type of the request (scenario, eqLogic, cmd, etc.) must correspond to the plugin. For example for the virtual plugin you had ````type=virtual```` in the url it is now necessary to replace by ````plugin=virtual&type=event````.
- Reinforcement of sessions : Change to sha256 with 64 characters in strict mode.

The Jeedom team is well aware that these changes can have an impact and be embarrassing for you, but we cannot compromise on safety.
The plugins must respect the recommendations on the tree structure of folders and files : [Doc](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/plugin_template).
