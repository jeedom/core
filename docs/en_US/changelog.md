### 4.4 : Remarques

> **Dashboard**
>
> On the **Dashboard** and the **Views**, Core v4.4 now automatically resizes tiles to build a seamless grid. The units (smallest height and smallest width of a tile) of this grid are defined in **Settings → System → Configuration / Interface** by values *Vertical pitch (minimum 100)* and *Horizontal pitch (minimum 110)*. The value *Margin* defining the space between the tiles.
> The tiles adapt to the dimensions of the grid and can be done once, twice etc. these values in height or width. It will certainly be necessary to pass [Dashboard edit mode](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/core/4.4/dashboard#Mode%20%C3%A9dition) to fine-tune the size of some tiles after the update.


> **Widgets**
>
> Core widgets have been rewritten in pure js/css. You will have to edit the Dashboard *(Edit then button ⁝ on the tiles)* and use the option *Line wrap after* on certain commands to find the same visual aspect.
> All Core widgets now support displaying *time*, by adding an optional parameter *time* / *duration* Where *date*.

> **Dialog boxes**
>
> All dialog boxes (bootstrap, bootbox, jQuery UI) have been migrated to an internal Core lib (jeeDialog) specially developed. Resizable dialogs now have a button to switch to *fullscreen*.

>**IMPORTANT**
>
> Following the update, you MUST go to Settings → System → Configuration Update / Market tab and enter the cloud backup password confirmation so that it can be done.

### 4.2 : Security

- In order to significantly increase the security of the Jeedom solution, the file access system has changed. Before certain files were prohibited from certain locations. From v4.2, files are explicitly allowed by type and location.
- Change at the API level, previously "tolerant" if you arrived with the Core key indicating plugin XXXXX. This is no longer the case, you must arrive with the key corresponding to the plugin.
- In http API you could indicate a plugin name in type, this is no longer possible. The type corresponding to the type of the request (scenario, eqLogic, cmd, etc.) must correspond to the plugin. For example for the virtual plugin you had ``type=virtual`` in the url it is now necessary to replace by ``plugin=virtual&type=event``.
- Reinforcement of sessions : Change to sha256 with 64 characters in strict mode.

The Jeedom team is well aware that these changes can have an impact and be embarrassing for you, but we cannot compromise on safety.
The plugins must respect the recommendations on the tree structure of folders and files : [Doctor](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/dev/plugin_template).
