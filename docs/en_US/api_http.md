Jeedom provides developers and users with an API
complete to be able to drive Jeedom from any object
logged.

Two APIs are available: a developer-oriented pilot
JSON RPC 2.0 and another via URL and HTTP request.

This API is very easily used by simple HTTP requests via
URL.

> **Note**
>
> For all this documentation, \ #IP \ _JEEDOM \ # corresponds to your url
> access to Jeedom. This is (unless you are connected to your network
> local) of the internet address you use to access Jeedom
> from the outside.

> **Note**
>
> For all this documentation, \ #API \ _KEY \ # corresponds to your key
> API, specific to your installation. To find it, you have to go to
> the "General" menu → "Configuration" → "General" tab.

Scenario
========

Here is the URL =
[Http: // \ #IP \ _JEEDOM \ # / core / api / jeeApi.php apikey = \ #APIKEY \ # & type = scenario & id = \ #ID \ # & action = \ #ACTION \ #?] (Http: // # # IP_JEEDOM / core / api / jeeApi.php? apikey aPIKEY = # # & type = scenario & id = # ID # & action = ACTION # #)

-   **id**: corresponds to the id of your scenario. The ID is on the
    page of the scenario concerned, in "tools" → "Scenarios", once the
    selected scenario, next to the name of the "General" tab. Other
    way to find it: in "Tools" → "Scenarios", click on
    "Overview".

-   **action**: corresponds to the action you want to apply. The
    available commands are: "start", "stop", "disable" and
    "activate" to respectively start, stop, disable or
    activate the scenario.

-   **tags** \ [optional]: if the action is "start", you can pass
    tags to the scenario (see the documentation on the scenarios) under
    the form tags = foo% 3D1%20tata% 3D2 (note that% 20 corresponds to a
    space and% 3D to =)

Info / Action command
====================

Here is the URL =
[Http: // \ #IP \ _JEEDOM \ # / jeedom / core / api / jeeApi.php apikey = \ #APIKEY \ # & type = cmd & id = \ #ID \ #?] (Http: // # # IP_JEEDOM / jeedom /core/api/jeeApi.php?apikey=#APIKEY#&type=cmd&id=#ID#)

-   **id**: is the id of what you want to drive or which
    you want to receive information

The easiest way to get this URL is to go to the Tools page →
Home automation summary, search for the command and open its configuration
advanced (the "gear" icon) and there you will see a URL that contains
already all that is needed depending on the type and subtype of the
command.

> **Note**
>
> It is possible for the \ #ID \ # field to pass several commands
> all of a sudden, for that you have to pass a painting in json (ex
>% 5B12,58,23% 5D, note that \ [and \] must be encoded hence the% 5B
> and% 5D). The return of Jeedom will be a json

> **Note**
>
> Parameters must be encoded for url, You can use
> a tool, [here] (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/)
