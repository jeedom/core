# Synthesis
**Home → Summary**

The page *Synthesis* offers you a centralized visual synthesis of your objects and their summaries.

![Synthesis](./images/synthesis_intro.gif)

For it to take on its full meaning, it is necessary on each object, to configure the summaries and a background image : [See abstracts documentation.](/en_US/concept/summary)

You can configure it as the default page in **Settings → Preferences**, in desktop and / or mobile.

## Affichage

On each object, its background image and its summaries are displayed :

Depending on the type of summary (key), visible in **Settings → System → Configuration / Summaries** :
- On the top corner left : The name of the object.
- Top right : Temperature (*temperature*) and humidity (*humidity*).
- Under the title : Alert (*security*) and Movement (*motion*), colored green or red depending on whether there are any alerts / movements in progress.
- Below : All other subject summaries.

The configuration of the display of the object is done in **Tools → Objects** :
- Her name.
- If it is visible. You can, however, keep an Object visible even on the Dashboard, but tick *Hide on Synthesis*.
- Its background image.
- If the background image should only be used on the Summary page or also in the background once on the object.
- The elements of his summaries, in the tab *Summary*.

> **Tip**
>
> The display order of objects is that of *Domotic overview*, that you can reorder (Analysis → Home automation summary).

> **Note**
>
> If an object does not have a summary defined, a button is displayed at the top right to access the configuration / summaries of the object.

## Fonctions

For each object, you can click :
- On the title of the object to display the Dashboard of this object with its child objects (also accessible from the menu *Home → Dashboard → Object*).
- On the image, to open the equipment page of this object only.
- On a summary element to display the elements of this object, of this type. These are displayed in a modal, without changing the page, and allows you to quickly close a shutter, turn on a light, etc. The size of the modal adapts to the equipment it must display, but you can move it. Even with the modal of summaries open, you can click on other summaries.


> **Tip**
>
> Ctrl Click or Center Click on the object or a summary element opens another tab of your browser.

When you click on an object from the synthesis, the button to the left of the search bar is replaced by a button allowing to display a preview of the parts to get there more quickly.
