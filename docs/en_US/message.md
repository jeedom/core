The message center contains all the important messages that you
must watch. He finds himself next to the time at the top right.

It is accessible only when there are messages by clicking on the
number of messages.

It is quite simple. It shows you the date and time of the message, the
plugin that issued it and the message in question. You can, by pressing
on the button at the very beginning of the line of a message, delete the
message (it will come back if the problem is still
news).

At the top, there is a selector to filter the messages on a
particular plugin and all right a button to empty all
messages.
