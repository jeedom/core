# Mass editor
**Settings → System → Configuration | OS / DB**

This tool allows you to edit a large number of equipment, commands, objects, or scenarios. It is completely generic, and automatically uses the schema and structure of the Jeedom database. It thus supports plugins and the configuration of their equipment.

> **Attention**
>
> If this tool is quite easy to use, it is intended for advanced users. Indeed, it is in fact very simple to change any parameter on dozens of devices or hundreds of commands and therefore to make certain functions inoperative, see even the Core.

## Utilisation

The part *Filtered* allows you to select what you want to edit, then add selection filters according to their parameters. A test button allows, without any modification, to show you the items selected by the filters entered.

The part *Edition* allows you to change parameters on these items.

- **Column** : Setting.
- **Value** : The value of the parameter.
- **Json value** : The property of the parameter / value if it is of type json (key-> value).
