# ModalDisplay

The page **ModalDisplay** is a simple container for loading the contents of a window (*modal* or *dialog*) full page.

It is used in particular in the following cases:
- Analysis menu : Ctrl Click / Click Center on *Real time*
- Tools menu : Ctrl Click / Click Center on *Notes*, *Expression tester*, *Variables*

> With a normal click (left click), these menus open a window, displaying the content over the rest of the interface. Here, the content of the window is displayed on this page, loaded in a new browser tab, to facilitate its use when the user wishes.
