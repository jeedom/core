# Design
**Home â†’ Design**

This page allows you to configure the display of all your home automation in a very fine way.
It takes time but its only limit is your imagination.

>If you have put a widget or an image that takes almost the entire design, you must click outside the widget or image to access the menu by right-clicking.

>**Delete a design that no longer works**
>In the administration part then OS / DB, make "select * from planHeader", recover the id of the design in question and make a "delete from planHeader where id=#TODO#" and "delete from plan where planHeader_id=#todo#" replacing well #TODO# by the design id previously found.
