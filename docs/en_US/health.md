**Analysis → Health**

The Jeedom Health page allows you to have a quick overview of the health status of your Jeedom.
It also indicates (if plugins use it) the state of health by plugin.

> Click on the icon at the top right to access the benchmark of your Jeedom.

Jeedom&#39;s health page is presented in the form of a double table.
The 1st column gives you a description of what Jeedom checks, the status is displayed in the 2nd column.
Tooltips can give you resolution tips if the verification is not OK.

Below you find the health for each plugin, a click on the name of the plugin gives the health detail of it.

On the right you find the icons :

-   Access port for plugin hardware (Zwave key type).
-   Demon mode.
-   Display of the plugin&#39;s equipment health page.
-   Display of the plugin configuration page.
-   Overall state of the plugin.

> Icons may vary depending on plugin.

> Generally when the line is green, everything is fine and when it is red, there is a problem.
